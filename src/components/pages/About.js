        <h1>About My Capstone</h1>
        <p>
          My Capstone was to create an e-commerce store. in this store you
          should be able to add products to a cart. these products are fetched
          from an api and brought in to what you see here on the page. the
          filters are also brought in from an api and displayed so you can
          select the filters.
        </p>
        <p>
          My Capstone was fairly easy but it has been an absolute pain with the
          nitty gritty stuff. I have learned throughout this course that
          whatever I think I know will definitely be tested. Thankfully I had a
          great instuctor that taught me how to figure things out. That is one
          of the most valueable skills I have learned.

        <h1>My Favorite Languages</h1>
        <p>
          My Favorite Languages have been JavaScript. When I first started the
          front end course I had a hard time with it because I thought python
          was a superior language because it was so much easier and made more
          sense. Now in my eyes, Python, is very ugly and takes a lot of the fun
          out of programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't get me wrong, Python is still a good language and I still enjoy
          it, I just enjoy the aspect of JavaScript where you want to build
          something you have to figure out how to build it for the most part
          insead of having all these built in functions to do it for you.
